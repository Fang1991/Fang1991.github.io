<h2>An Analysis of Chinese Poems with Voyant
</h2>
<p>It is not easy for me to expertly use Voyant to do analysis. To avoid a fruitless research, I would love to start from something I am familiar with. 
In this case, I may use voyant to prove what I have known, also expect some surprise that voyant may offer. So I selected two books which are about Chinese poems.
They are A Hundred and Seventy Chinese Poems and 300 Tang Poems.
