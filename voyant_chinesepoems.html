<h2>An Analysis of Chinese Poems with Voyant
</h2>
<p>It is not easy for me to use Voyant expertly. To avoid a fruitless analysis, I would love to start from something I am familiar with. 
So I selected two books which are about Chinese poems. They are <a href="Fang1991.github.io/170 Chinese Poems.docx">A Hundred and Seventy Chinese Poems</a> and <a href="Fang1991.github.io/300 Tang Poems.pdf">300 Tang Poems</a> respectively. 
The first book is translated by Arthur Waley and published in March of 2013. It contains Chinese poems from first century B.C. to 846 A.D. 
and most of them haven't been translated before. The second book is originally from Chinese version which is first publish in 1959. The author 
is Sung Zhu, a Chinese hermit in Ching dynasty. In 1997 this book is edited by UVa based on Mr. Wei-chang Shan's electronic version.
English translations are mainly from Witter Bynner's Jade mountain (check the introduction page of this book for more information). This collection contains 311 Chinese poems from Tang dynasty(618-907 A.D.).
I chose these two books because they almost include all kinds of poems in Chinese poetry era. By comaparing them, I may find something interesting
and valuable.

  <p>After I cleaned up both texts (only titles and poems themselves left), I uploaded them to Voyant. The result as follows:
