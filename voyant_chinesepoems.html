<h2>An Analysis of Chinese Poems with Voyant
</h2>
<p>It is not easy for me to use Voyant expertly. To avoid a fruitless analysis, I started from something I am familiar with. 
So I selected two books about Chinese poems. They are <a href="Fang1991.github.io/170 Chinese Poems.docx">A Hundred and Seventy 
Chinese Poems</a> and <a href="Fang1991.github.io/300 Tang Poems.pdf">300 Tang Poems</a>. 
The first book is translated by Arthur Waley and firt published in 1918. The electronic version I viewed is published in March of 2013. 
It contains Chinese poems from first century B.C. to 846 A.D.. The second book is originally from Chinese version which is first 
publish in 1959. The author is Sung Zhu, a Chinese hermit in Ching dynasty. In 1997 this book is edited into English by UVa based on 
Mr. Wei-chang Shan's electronic version. English translations are mainly from Witter Bynner's Jade mountain 
(check the introduction page of this book for more information). This collection contains more than 300 Chinese poems of Tang dynasty
(618-907 A.D.). I chose these two books because they almost include all kinds of poems in Chinese poetry era. By comaparing them, I found something interesting
and valuable.

  <p>After I cleaned up both texts (only titles and poems left), I uploaded them to Voyant. The result as follows:

  <P>From the Cirrus I notice that many of those high-frequency words are natural images, such as moon, mountain, wind, sky, river, etc. 
  This exactly proves one of the most important characteristics of ancient Chinese pomes - poets are very good at using natural imagies 
  to express personal emotions.
  Some of the images even have been solified to indicate a certain type of feeling. For instance, the image of "moon" always connects 
  to homesickness.</p>     
  
  <p>According to the Trends, top 5 high-frequency words are like, river, wind, old and mountain. Among them, river and mountain show 
  the biggest difference in two texts.
  These two words appear more often in 300 Tang Poems(2) than in A Hundred and Seventy Chinese Poems(1), almost four times. 
  This may suggest that Tang poets like using river and mountain to express feelings more than poets in dynasties prior to Tang. 
  It is said that Tang poets are more romantic than poets in other dynasities.</p>
  
  <p>As to the most popular word in these two texts - "like". I think there's a reason for that. Chinese poems involve a great deal of 
  metaphors and similes. Poets like to describe things or feelings in an imaginative way. When I go back to Voyant, the widget of 
  Contexts seems to prove this:</p>

<p>For example, "The foe roll up like clouds", "It rumbles low with a noise like a thunder" in A Hundred and Seventy Chinese Poems(1);
 "Hope goes out, like the light of the candle", "May, like a wanderer, never came back..." in 300 Tang Poems(2). These reflect that the 
 application of rhetoric in Chinese poetry plays a very important part.
 However, I am a little bit surprised to see that "old" is one of top fives. To figure out if there's a good explanation for this phenomenon, 
  I went back to the Contexts again. See the widget below:</p>

 <p>It seems that Chinese poets like to use "old" to describe things as much as they can, such as "old gate", "old temple", "old friend", 
 "old wife", "old man", especially "old age". It seems they are particularly afraid of getting old. Poets use these phrases either to 
 commemorate things that no longer exist or to regret their lost youth. Also, it might be just a humble way to address things as "old".
 </p>
  
  <p>At last, I think using Voyant tools to analyze texts that one is familiar with is much more pleasant. With familiar texts one may 
   easily notice the important but often being overlooked information. This information may provide good ideas for further researches. 
   Take the word "old" in my analysis above as an example, I didn't know that ancient Chinese poets use so many "old" in their poetry, 
   and mostly in a nagative way. This makes me really want to do a research about why they are so passive; what motivates them compose 
   so nagative poems; why they are so afriad of being old... I also tried to analyze texts that I am not familiar with with Voyant, I couldn't get 
   so much as I did here.
