<h2>An Analysis of Chinese Poems with Voyant
</h2>
<p>It is not easy for me to use Voyant expertly. To avoid a fruitless analysis, I would love to start from something I am familiar with. 
So I selected two books which are about Chinese poems. They are <a href="Fang1991.github.io/170 Chinese Poems.docx">A Hundred and Seventy Chinese Poems</a> and <a href="Fang1991.github.io/300 Tang Poems.pdf">300 Tang Poems</a> respectively. 
The first book is translated by Arthur Waley and published in March of 2013. It contains Chinese poems from first century B.C. to 846 A.D. 
and most of them haven't been translated before. The second book is originally from Chinese version which is first publish in 1959. The author 
is Sung Zhu, a Chinese hermit in Ching dynasty. In 1997 this book is edited by UVa based on Mr. Wei-chang Shan's electronic version.
English translations are mainly from Witter Bynner's Jade mountain (check the introduction page of this book for more information). This collection contains 311 Chinese poems from Tang dynasty(618-907 A.D.).
I chose these two books because they almost include all kinds of poems in Chinese poetry era. By comaparing them, I may find something interesting
and valuable.

  <p>After I cleaned up both texts (only titles and poems themselves left), I uploaded them to Voyant. The result as follows:

  <P>From the Cirrus I notice that many of those high-frequency words are natural images, such as moon, mountain, wind, sky, river, etc. 
  This exactly proves one of the most important characteristics of ancient Chinese pomes - poets are very good at using natural imagies to express personal emotions.
  Some of the images even have been solified to indicate a certain type of feeling. For instance, the image of "moon" always connects to homesickness.</p>     
  
  <p>According to the Trends, top 5 high-frequency words are like, river, wind, old and mountain. Among them, river and mountain show the biggest difference in two texts.
  These two words appear more often in 300 Tang Poems(2) than in A Hundred and Seventy Chinese Poems(1), almost four times. This may suggest that Tang poets like using
    river and mountain to express feelings more than poets in dynasties prior to Tang.</p>
  
  <p>As to the most popular word in these two texts - "like". I think there's a reason for that. Chinese poems involve a great deal of metaphors and similes. 
  poets like to describe things or feelings in an imaginative way. When I go back to Voyant, the widget of Contexts seems to prove this point:</p>
